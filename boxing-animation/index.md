# Boxing Animation

This project was part of my mechanisms class, in which we were tasked to create an automated mechanisnm of a sport powered by a single hand-crank, utilizng multiple 4 bar linakegs and other mechanisms such as Geneva wheels, cam systems, and slider-cranks. 

## Skills Applied
- Mechanism synthesis
- Design
- CAD modelling 

## The Process
###  Design Selection
- This design was selc
- Potential Designs:
- Weighted Objective Chart:
- Scale was decided to be 1/10th

### Mechanism Breakdown
- The autamation conists of 5 individual mechanisms resulting in the following motions:
1. Dodge
   - Motion replicated using four-bar linkage with 3 preciosiisn points and an additonal dyad
   - Graphical mechanism synthesis using motion generation:
   - Resultant four-bar mechanism motion:
3. Kick
   - Motion replicated using four-bar linkage with three percison points and an addtioanl dyad
   - Grpaial mechanism sythesis using path genration with prescribed timing (mechanism will move twice as fast during leg extension portion of movement):
   - Resultant fourbar mefchnism motion:
5. Punch
   -Motion replicated uisng slider-crank mechanism
   -Dteremined dyad from max shoudlere and min shoudler angle
   - Resultant slider crank motion:
7. Bell
   -Ringing of bell replicated using cam and follower system
   -Cam was determined via
   -Resultant motion of riging of bell:
9. Clock
    - clock was replcaited using a genve a wheel, with each roation reuslting in the chanign of the number
    - mechanism counts down form 5 seconds
    - Resultant clock:

### Mechanism Sychronatization
- Mehcanisms were synchoronzied using gears, with the dodge, kick andn bell all compelting there mmtion in 1 rotation (1:1 gear rations), the punch compaletes tow raotions in one cycle and thus has 2:1 gear roation and th clock completes 6 cycles iiin opne rotation so  a 6:1 gear ratios
- Gearing abnd synchrozntion of system:

### Boxing Ring and Boxer Modelling
- Boxing ring was modelled with inspriration from olympic standard ring, using a 1/10th sacle
- Boxers were mdoelled stratgically with degrees of freedom allowing for correct movement

### Putting it all Together 
- Resultant animation:
