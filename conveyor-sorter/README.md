# Conveyor Sorter

This project was part of the mechatronics class, it utilized an ATmega2560 and L298N motor driver to sort objects by material using optical and reflective sensors.

## ðŸš€ Skills Applied
- Embedded C programming
- Stepper motor control
- S-curve motion profile modeling
- System troubleshooting
- In depth MCU understanding

## Sorting System in Action
disclaimer - video below is not full speed of sorter. At full speed it sorted 48 pieces in 26 seconds.
